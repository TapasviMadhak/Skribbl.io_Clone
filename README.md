## How to Play
1. Join a Room: Enter a room code to join an existing game or create a new room.

2. Drawing: The drawer selects a word and draws it on the canvas while others guess.

3. Guessing: Players type their guesses in the chat box. Correct guesses earn points.

4. Scoring: Points are awarded based on correct guesses. The drawer also earns points for each correct guess.

5. Turn Transition: The game automatically transitions to the next turn once the timer expires or all players have guessed correctly.

6. End of Game: The game ends after a set number of rounds. Scores are displayed, and the player with the highest score is crowned the winner.

### Scoring System
- Correct Guess:
  * Player: 10 points per correct guess.
  * Drawer: 10 points per correct guess made by other players.
- Guessing Order:
  * First correct guesser earns an additional 5 points.
- Time-Based Scoring (Optional):
  * Faster guesses may yield more points.
